# Zombie-Game
Overview: The goal of this software project was to design and implement
features for a console-based "rogue-like" game in Java using object-oriented
programming principles. This project was completed in a group of two, hence
GitLab was used to conduct collaborative coding.

My Role:
- Creating a detailed UML design for the features planned to implement.
Implementing the planned features using OOP principles.

Outcomes:
- A well detailed UML that clearly highlighted the design methodology and
features.
- A working zombie-based game with unique features that can be played
within the console.
- Overall, clean coding with plenty of comments and Java documentation.
